{"name":"Libungif","tagline":"","body":"This is libungif, a library for manipulating gif files in a manner compatible\r\nwith libgif, the gif library authored and maintainer by Eric S. Raymond.\r\nThe observant builder of this package may in fact notice that this package\r\nis mostly Eric S. Raymond's libgif with a few changes (Please see the NEWS\r\nfile)\r\n\r\nLatest versions of libungif are available from sourceforge:\r\n    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libungif\r\n\r\n====\r\nBuilding this package should be as simple as:\r\n\r\n    ./configure\r\n    gmake\r\n    gmake install\r\n\r\n====\r\nDeprecation list.  Will be removed in libungif 5.0:\r\n* GIF_ERROR and GIF_MESSAGE are on the deprecation list as they are also\r\n  utility helper functions rather than essential to the functioning of the\r\n  library.\r\n* The qprintf methods of the library are now deprecated.  Do not use \r\n  GifQuietPrint or GifQprintf.  These should have been pushed out into the\r\n  utility helper library instead of sitting around in the library proper at\r\n  the same time as the getarg functions were moved out.  Getting rid of these\r\n  will let us get rid of our dependence on stdarg.h/varargs.h (Which a Gif\r\n  reading library has no business requiring.)\r\n* In the SavedImage struct: int Function will be removed.  Use\r\n  SavedImage.ExtensionBlocks[x].Function instead.\r\n* In gifalloc.c: MakeExtension is deprecated as well.  Use AddExtensionBlock\r\n  instead.  (This and the previous int Function were deprecated because they\r\n  only handle one Extension per image.  The new code handles multiple\r\n  extensions.)\r\n* varargs style interface in qprintf and getarg: It's a mistake to have two\r\n  different interfaces that depend on compile time choices between varargs\r\n  and stdargs.  The future is to get rid of varargs style altogether.\r\n  (Also: these are probably going strictly into the utility functions so\r\n  the library won't have to worry about them at all.)\r\n====\r\n\r\nI have found that automake currently generates Makefile's containing some\r\nGNUmake specific syntax.  If you're having troubles building with your\r\nsystem provided make, please install GNU make and try rebuilding.\r\n\r\n====\r\nThis package uses autoconf, automake, and libtool to create the configure\r\nscript, so if you need to edit the configure.ac or change a makefile target\r\nyou should read the DEVELOPER file for hints on recreating the distribution\r\nusing these tools.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n-Toshio Kuratomi <toshio@tiki-lounge.com>\r\n\r\n==== READ.ME file for giflib version 3.0:\r\n\r\n\t\t\tREAD ME for GIFLIB\r\n\r\nFor complete documentation on the package, point a web browser at\r\ndoc/index.html.
